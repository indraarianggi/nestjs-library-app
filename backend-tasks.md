- [x] Check for overdue loans (blocks borrowing)
- [x] Check for unpaid penalties (blocks borrowing)
- [x] Check book availability and status
- [x] Validate copyId if provided, auto-select if not
- [x] Find available copy (status=AVAILABLE, no open loans)

```typescript
// Validation steps
1. Get member profile and settings
2. Validate membership status === ACTIVE
3. Count active loans (ACTIVE, APPROVED, OVERDUE)
4. Check: activeLoanCount < settings.maxConcurrentLoans
5. Find available copy:
   - copy.status = AVAILABLE
   - NOT EXISTS loan on copy with status IN (APPROVED, ACTIVE, OVERDUE)

  - If copyId provided, validates it belongs to the book and status=AVAILABLE
  - If copyId not provided, auto-selects first AVAILABLE copy for the book
  - Returns 404 if no available copies
- Loan creation logic:
  - Status: APPROVED if approvalsRequired=false, REQUESTED if true (from Settings)
  - borrowedAt: now if APPROVED, null if REQUESTED
  - dueDate: now + loanDays if APPROVED, null if REQUESTED (from Settings)
  - renewalCount: 0
  - penaltyAccrued: 0
- Copy status updated to ON_LOAN only if loan status=APPROVED
- Notification email sent (placeholder implementation with logging)
- Audit log entry created with action='loan.created'
- Returns 201 with loan details including book and copy relations
- Proper error responses:
  - 400 for validation errors

**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimated Time:** 6 hours | **Dependencies:** BE-5.1

**Description:**
~~Implement endpoint for members to create a loan request for a specific book.~~ This task has been consolidated into BE-5.2. The `POST /api/loans` endpoint now supports both scenarios:

- If `copyId` provided: validates that specific copy
- If `copyId` NOT provided: system auto-selects first available copy

**Original API Endpoint:** ~~`POST /api/loans/request`~~ → **Now using:** `POST /api/loans` with optional `copyId`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "bookId": "uuid",
  "copyId": "uuid" // OPTIONAL - auto-selected if not provided
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Member role only (authenticated)
- [x] CreateLoanRequestDto with bookId validation
- [x] Validate member status is ACTIVE (return 403 if PENDING or SUSPENDED)
- [x] Check member doesn't exceed maxConcurrentLoans (from Settings)
- [x] Check book exists and status is ACTIVE
- [x] Find available copy (status=AVAILABLE, no open loans)
- [x] If no available copy, return 409 "No copies available"
- [x] If settings.approvalsRequired = false:
  - Create loan with status=APPROVED
  - Set borrowedAt=now, dueDate=now + settings.loanDays
  - Update copy status to ON_LOAN
  - Send "loan approved" email notification
- [x] If settings.approvalsRequired = true:
  - Create loan with status=REQUESTED
  - borrowedAt and dueDate remain null
  - Copy status remains AVAILABLE (not assigned yet)
  - Send "loan requested" email notification to admin
- [x] Audit log entry created with action='loan.requested' or 'loan.approved'
- [x] Returns 201 with loan details
- [x] Returns 400 for validation errors
- [x] Returns 403 for suspended members or maxLoans exceeded
- [x] Returns 404 if book not found
- [x] Returns 409 if no available copies

**Business Rules:**

- Member must have ACTIVE status
- Member cannot exceed maxConcurrentLoans (count loans with status: APPROVED, ACTIVE, OVERDUE)
- Only books with status=ACTIVE can be borrowed
- Auto-approval assigns first available copy immediately
- Manual approval requires admin to choose copy and approve

**Definition of Done:**

- [x] Members can request loans for available books
- [x] Auto-approval works when enabled
- [x] Manual approval workflow initiated when required
- [x] All validations enforced
- [x] Email notifications sent
- [x] Audit trail captured
- [x] Transaction ensures atomicity

**Completion Notes:**

- ~~POST /api/loans/request endpoint~~ **CONSOLIDATED INTO BE-5.2**
- The `POST /api/loans` endpoint now handles both use cases:
  - Member specifies book only (copyId omitted) → system auto-selects
  - Member specifies both book and copy → validates specific copy
- This consolidation eliminates redundant code and provides a cleaner API
- All business logic, validations, and error handling remain the same
- See BE-5.2 completion notes for full implementation details

## Summary

### Total Estimated Time: **40-45 days** (single developer)

### Task Dependencies Flow:

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
  → Phase 2 (Auth)
    → Phase 3 (Books & Catalog)
      → Phase 4 (Memberships)
        → Phase 5 (Loans)
          → Phase 6 (Notifications)
            → Phase 7 (Testing)
              → Phase 8 (Docs & Deploy)
```

### Parallelization Opportunities:

- Authors, Categories modules can be built in parallel with Books
- Members module can be built while Loans is in progress
- Notifications can be developed alongside Loans
- Testing can start as soon as individual modules complete
- Documentation can be written incrementally

### Critical Path (High Priority):

1. Database setup and schema (BE-1.2 to BE-1.5)
2. Authentication (BE-2.1 to BE-2.5)
3. Books catalog (BE-3.3 to BE-3.6)
4. Loans creation and return (BE-5.2, BE-5.6)
5. Integration testing (BE-8.2)

### Integration Points for Frontend:

- **API Contract**: Refer to `api-contract.yaml` for all endpoint specifications
- **Authentication**: Session cookie-based, obtained via `/api/auth/login`
- **Authorization**: Role-based (Admin vs Member), enforced server-side
- **Pagination**: Standard query params (page, pageSize), consistent response format
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- **CORS**: Frontend URL must be configured in backend environment variables

### Notes:

- All tasks include acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Audit logging should be added to all state-changing operations
- Transactions should be used for multi-step operations (e.g., loan creation)
- All endpoints should have proper error handling and validation
- Testing is mandatory before marking task as complete
- Frontend team can start integration as soon as endpoints are documented and deployed

## Next Steps:

1. Review and approve task breakdown with team
2. Set up project tracking (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira)
3. Assign tasks based on dependencies and developer availability
4. Begin Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
5. Daily standups to track progress and blockers
6. Weekly demos to showcase completed features
7. Continuous integration with frontend team
