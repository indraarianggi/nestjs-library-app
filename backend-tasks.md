## Summary

### Total Estimated Time: **40-45 days** (single developer)

### Task Dependencies Flow:
```
Phase 1 (Foundation) 
  → Phase 2 (Auth) 
    → Phase 3 (Books & Catalog) 
      → Phase 4 (Memberships)
        → Phase 5 (Loans) 
          → Phase 6 (Notifications)
            → Phase 7 (Testing)
              → Phase 8 (Docs & Deploy)
```

### Parallelization Opportunities:
- Authors, Categories modules can be built in parallel with Books
- Members module can be built while Loans is in progress
- Notifications can be developed alongside Loans
- Testing can start as soon as individual modules complete
- Documentation can be written incrementally

### Critical Path (High Priority):
1. Database setup and schema (BE-1.2 to BE-1.5)
2. Authentication (BE-2.1 to BE-2.5)
3. Books catalog (BE-3.3 to BE-3.6)
4. Loans creation and return (BE-5.2, BE-5.6)
5. Integration testing (BE-8.2)

### Integration Points for Frontend:
- **API Contract**: Refer to `api-contract.yaml` for all endpoint specifications
- **Authentication**: Session cookie-based, obtained via `/api/auth/login`
- **Authorization**: Role-based (Admin vs Member), enforced server-side
- **Pagination**: Standard query params (page, pageSize), consistent response format
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- **CORS**: Frontend URL must be configured in backend environment variables

### Notes:
- All tasks include acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Audit logging should be added to all state-changing operations
- Transactions should be used for multi-step operations (e.g., loan creation)
- All endpoints should have proper error handling and validation
- Testing is mandatory before marking task as complete
- Frontend team can start integration as soon as endpoints are documented and deployed

## Next Steps:
1. Review and approve task breakdown with team
2. Set up project tracking (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira)
3. Assign tasks based on dependencies and developer availability
4. Begin Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
5. Daily standups to track progress and blockers
6. Weekly demos to showcase completed features
7. Continuous integration with frontend team
